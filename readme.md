# Speed Up WordPress

This is a WordPress plugin designed to disable specific WordPress features through a GUI in the admin panel, potentially speeding up your site. I created this plugin to streamline the optimization process of WordPress websites and as a learning experience. I plan to add new features over time to continually improve the plugin's functionality.

## Purpose

The purpose of this plugin is to provide an easy and efficient way to optimize WordPress websites. By disabling certain features that are not always necessary, you can potentially speed up your site and improve its performance. This plugin is also a learning project for me, and I'm using it to improve my skills and knowledge in WordPress plugin development.

## Features

- **Disable Emojis**: Emojis are small digital images or icons used to express an idea or emotion. While they can make your content more engaging, they also add extra HTTP requests and slow down your site. If you don't use them, it's better to disable them.

- **Disable Embeds**: Embeds allow you to embed videos, images, tweets, audio, and other content from external sources in your WordPress site. This feature adds extra HTTP requests and can slow down your site. If you don't use it, it's better to disable it.

- **Disable XML-RPC**: XML-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol which uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism. Disabling it can help improve your site's performance and security.

## Future Features

I plan to add more features to this plugin over time. If you have any suggestions or feature requests, please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter at @jordan_thirkle.
